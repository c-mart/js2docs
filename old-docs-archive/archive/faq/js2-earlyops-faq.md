  **3. When will Jetstream2 be available for Jetstream2 Trial allocations?**

Jetstream2 Trial Allocations will be made available after Jetstream2 goes into production. They will likely not be available in early user operations.

Until Jetstream2 completes National Science Foundation (NSF) acceptance testing, timelines remain uncertain. Once acceptance testing has been completed, documented, presented and approved by the NSF, we will be able to publish a more definitive timeline.
