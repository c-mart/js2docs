# Budgeting for Common Usage Scenarios

Note: If you already have a clear picture of what resources your project requires, you can now estimate your SU needs using the usage estimation calculator here: [Usage Estimation Calculator](../alloc/estimator.md){target=_blank}
{: .note}

Because Jetstream2 is available solely through [SUs converted from ACCESS credits](../general/access.md){target=_blank}, it is often helpful to have a plan for what compute resources your project intends to use and to budget SU expenditure before submitting an exchange request. The goal of this document is to provide examples of common usage scenarios for Jetstream2 and how one might budget for them.

## "Always-On" Infrastructure

Because of its lack of restrictions on runtime for CPU resources and the ability to route external traffic to instances (for example with a public IP address), an extremely common use case for Jetstream2 is hosting persistent or "always-on" infrastructure for projects. This category of instances might encompass things like web servers, science gateways, data hosts, and JupyterHub/RStudio servers.
