# Jetstream2 Allocation Extensions and Renewals

If your allocation is expired or close to expired and has adequate SUs remaining for the resource(s), you may request an extension if you need 3-6 months to complete your work or to prepare for a research allocation. If you are planning to continue your research for another year (or more), you should pursue a renewal of your allocation.

Detailed information about the extension request process is available from the [XSEDE Manage Allocations](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing#managealloc-extensions){target=_blank} page.

***Please note: Extensions are not a substitution for the renewal process.*** <br><br>
***A renewal is ALWAYS preferred over an extension. Please see below for information on renewing a startup allocation.***
{: .note}

If you have a startup allocation and you are planning to stay under the startup limits (as noted on the [Jetstream Resources](../general/resources.md) page), you may continue to renew your startup and not have to enter the research allocations cycle.

* Research allocations may be extended **once** with *adequate justification*.
* Research allocations are renewable on a quarterly basis. More information may be found on the [XSEDE Research Allocations page](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research){target=_blank}

    * (You can also mouse over the "Allocations tab" and then select "Submit/Review Request")

* Select the duration from the list.
* Enter all comments and justifications for the extension.
