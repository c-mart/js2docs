# Jetstream2 Trial Allocations (JTA)

!!! warning "JTA Coming Soon"
Trial allocations will be available Q2 2022.</br>This page will be updated with more information as we near that time.

Jetstream2 is an NSF/ACCESS resource designed to promote and provide configurable cyberinfrastructure in the form of cloud computing virtual computers (VMs) to both novice and experienced users. ACCESS offers Trial Access allocations (JTA) to Jetstream2 for evaluation purposes.

JTA provide expedited but limited access for potential users to Jetstream2 (JS2), such that, within one business day, approved users will be able to access JS2 and evaluate deploying a VM prior to requesting a larger STARTUP, EDUCATION, or RESEARCH allocation. JTA are limited to:

- `1000` Service Units on the main JS2 cloud at Indiana University (IU)</br> ( access to Regional clouds at TACC, ASU, UH, or Cornell is NOT currently provided)
- `1 m3.tiny` (single core) or `1 m3.small` (2-core) Virtual Machine (VM) instance per cloud at a time</br> ( see  https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/general/vmsizes/#jetstream2-cpu )
- `1` VM backup snapshot per instance
- `1` small 10 GB disk external storage volume.

This is enough capacity to give new users an experience with virtual computing and try some "cloud-native" work, but is not a substantial usage of the system. While Virtual GPUs are available on JS2, they are outside the scope of the JTA and NOT currently provided.

**NOTE**: The limits applied to JTA users are intrinsic to the allocation and cannot be increased.
