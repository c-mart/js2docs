# Jetstream2 Allocations Overview

!!! Notice "XSEDE to ACCESS transition"

     Please note that as XSEDE concludes operation and transitions to ACCESS, all of the allocations documentation will need to be updated. We will get it updated to reflect ACCESS as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.</br>

*Access to Jetstream2 is available solely through Xtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) allocations. You must be on a valid allocation or the PI of a valid allocation to have access to Jetstream2.*

Jetstream allocations are awarded exclusively through XSEDE. XSEDE provides XSEDE User Portal (XUP) accounts free of charge. XSEDE allocations require that the Principal Investigator (PI) be a US-based researcher.

A guide with more detail on Jetstream allocations is available online at the
[XSEDE Resource Information](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/resource-info){target=_blank} page.

### Allocation types:

- [Trial allocation](trial.md) - *Limited in hours and cores*, non-renewable, meant to explore using Jetstream2
- [Startup allocation](startup.md) - For smaller scale research or exploratory usage before applying for a larger research allocation. Not intended for any courses or workshops.
    * [Campus Champions](https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions) allocations will generally default to this level, though other limits are available upon request.
- [Education allocation](education.md) - For workshops, tutorials, or courses. Startup limits may not apply.
- [Research allocation](research.md) - Larger scale allocations intended for research. Limits are generally only in what the PI can justify requesting.

!!! warning "Campus Champions"

    Please note that we will **NOT** be automatically adding [Campus Champions](https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions) allocations to Jetstream2. You will explicitly need to get a [supplement](/alloc/supplement/) for it.

#### Maximum Trial Allocation values for each resource are:

* Jetstream2 CPU - 2,000 SUs, 2 cores

#### Maximum Startup/Campus Champion Allocation values for each resource are:

* Jetstream2 CPU - 200,000 SUs
* Jetstream2 Large Memory - 400,000 SUs
* Jetstream2 GPU - 600,000 SUs
* Jetstream2 Storage - 1TB default**&ast;**

**&ast;** Storage limits may be larger than 1TB per allocation for a startup if well-justified.
