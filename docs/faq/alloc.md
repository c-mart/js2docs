#Jetstream2 Allocations FAQ

!!! Notice "XSEDE to ACCESS transition"

     Please note that as XSEDE concludes operation and transitions to ACCESS, all of the allocations documentation will need to be updated. We will get it updated to reflect ACCESS as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.</br>

####Is there an overview of the types of allocations available as well as any restrictions those allocations have?

> The [Getting Started guide](https://www.xsede.org/for-users/getting-started){target=_blank} describes the process of getting onto XSEDE, applying for allocations and using XSEDE resources. To review the types of allocations XSEDE and the process to get an allocation, here are some links you might find useful:

>  *   [Allocations overview](https://www.xsede.org/web/guest/allocations){target=_blank}
  *   [Types of allocations, eligibility, details](https://www.xsede.org/web/xup/documentation-overview#allocations-types){target=_blank}
  *   [Allocation policies](https://portal.xsede.org/allocation-policies){target=_blank}
  *   [Submit and manage allocation requests](https://www.xsede.org/group/xup/submit-request){target=_blank}
  *   [Proposal deadlines](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research#schedule){target=_blank}

####Is there a example or demonstration of how to get an allocation that I could follow?

> The [Research Allocation](../alloc/research.md) page has information and links for writing a successful Jetstream2 research allocation request.
>
> There is a Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) on getting a Research Allocation for Jetstream here: https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/JetstreamReq/. It is not updated for Jetstream2 though the principles are the same.

####How do I let other XSEDE accounts use my allocation?

You can add users to (or remove them from) your XSEDE allocation via the XSEDE User Portal. Users must have already created their XSEDE accounts before they can be added to an allocation.

> To add users to, or remove them from, an active Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment ([XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/documents/527334/695761/what-is-XSEDE.pdf){target=_blank}) allocation, the principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or [allocation manager](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing#manageusers){target=_blank} can follow the instructions here:

>  * [https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/managing){target=_blank}

!!! Note
    **It can take up to four hours for users added to an allocation to become active.**

####How often can I get a startup allocation?

> Applications for startup allocations will only be accepted once. If you have modest needs that are equal or less than startup values, you may renew your startup allocation. If you need a larger allocation, it is best to apply for a [research allocation](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/research){target=_blank}.

> Maximum Startup/Campus Champion Allocation values for each resource are:<br>
> * Jetstream2 CPU - 200,000 SUs<br>
> * Jetstream2 Large Memory - 400,000 SUs<br>
> * Jetstream2 GPU - 600,000 SUs<br>
> * Jetstream2 Storage - 1TB default*<p>
>
> * Storage limits may be larger than 1TB per allocation for a startup if well-justified.

---

####Can I renew a startup allocation?

> If your SU needs are equal to or less than the maximum startup values (see item 4 just above) you may renew your startup allocation. If you need a signficantly larger amound of SUs for any of the resources, you will need to pursue a [research allocation](../alloc/research.md)

> Startup allocations may be renewed at 30 days or less before expiration. Please refer to [Instructions for requesting a renewal](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/renew-extend/#instructions-for-requesting-a-renewal) for more information.

---

####I'm running out of Service Units (SUs) or storage. How do I request more?

> If you already have an XSEDE allocation and need to request additional service units (SUs), the PI, co-PI, or delegate may submit a request via the XSEDE User Portal. For instructions on how to submit the request, see [Requesting additional SUs, other Jetstream resources, or storage for Jetstream -- Supplemental Allocations](../alloc/supplement.md){target=_blank}.

!!! Note

    Supplements only add SUs/storage. If you need more time on your allocation, you need to pursue a renewal or extension.
---

####I am at or exceeding the quota limits for my allocation.

> How do I request additional resources such as CPUs and memory?

> You may contact *help@jetstream-cloud.org* or open a ticket via either the [ACCESS Help Form](https://support.access-ci.org/user/login?destination=/open-a-ticket){target=_blank} or the [Jetstream Help Form](https://jetstream-cloud.org/contact/index.html){target=_blank} with those requests.

> It's important to note that Jetstream Trial Allocation quotas are fixed and will **NOT** be increased under any circumstances.

> For other allocation types, justification will be required and will be granted at the discretion of the Jetstream2 staff based on the justification and available resources. Please note that large memory and GPU resources are limited so requests for those will require strong justification for success or partial success. We strive to make resources available to all researchers that require them, so striking a balance between the needs of one versus many is often necessary.

---

####Can you extend my allocation for me or give me access to my allocation for just a few days/weeks/months more?

> If your allocation is expired or out of SUs, you may request an extension, renewal, or supplement. Please see one of the following links:
>
> * [Requesting additional SUs, other Jetstream resources, or storage for Jetstream -- Supplemental Allocations](../alloc/supplement.md){target=_blank}
>
> * [Jetstream2 Allocation Extensions and Renewals](../alloc/renew-extend.md){target=_blank}
>
> Jetstream2 staff are unable to take these actions on your behalf.

!!! Note

    Extensions only add time. If you need more or different resources, you need to pursue a supplement.

####My PI got a Jetstream2 supplement added to our existing allocation but we cannot access Exosphere or Horizon

> When you get a supplement for a resource that you have not previously had, users on your allocation are not automatically enabled for it. To enable users for a new resource like Jetstream2, your PI, Co-PI, or resource managers may need to go to your [Allocations/Usage page](https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/allocations/usage){target=_blank} and select the "Manage Users" button for the appropriate project.
