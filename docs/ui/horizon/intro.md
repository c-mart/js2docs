#Horizon

Horizon is a web-based GUI for interacting with the Openstack API. It is likely the most complete GUI for working with Openstack but isn't the fastest or most user-friendly. Almost all functionality that is available from the CLI is available in Horizon. [Exosphere](../exo/exo.md) and [Cacao](../cacao/intro.md) both provide subsets of Horizon functionality with more focus on ease of use.

That said, there are times you may need the more complete features of Horizon instead of the other GUI interfaces. This documentation will cover the basics of launching, using, and managing instances, using various storage options in Horizon, using container orchestration engines, and other aspects of using Openstack.
