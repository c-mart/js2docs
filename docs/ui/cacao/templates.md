# Templates

A template refers to a set of instructions or a description of what cloud resources to create in a cloud. A template in CACAO requires a template engine to process these instructions. Currently, CACAO only supports Hashicorp Terraform templates, including any embedded scripts or code that is supported through Terraform's [local-exec provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec), such as Ansible.

**_Note_:** &#9432; At this time, new templates can only be added through the CACAO API; the UI will support importing new templates soon.

## Template catalog

The templates interface provides a catalog view of existing templates that are public, shared to you by other users, or ones that you imported.
